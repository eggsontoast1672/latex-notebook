Definition: A homeomorphism is an isomorphism in the category of topological
spaces. In other words, it is a bijective and continuous between topological
spaces that has a continuous inverse function.

Definition: An n-manifold is a topological space with the property that each
point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of
n-dimensional Euclidian space.

Definition: A diffeomorphism is an isomorphism of differentiable manifolds. It
is an invertible function that maps one differentiable manifold to another such
that both the function and its inverse are continuously differentiable.
