\begin{exercise}
  Show that $\alpha + \beta = \beta + \alpha$ for all $\alpha, \beta \in \C$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  Let $\alpha = a_1 + b_1i$ and $\beta = a_2 + b_2i$ be complex numbers.

  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      (a_1 + b_1i) + (a_2 + b_2i)
        & = (a_1 + a_2) + (b_1 + b_2)i  \\
        & = (a_2 + a_1) + (b_2 + b_1)i  \\
        & = (a_2 + b_2i) + (a_1 + b_1i) \\
    \end{aligned}
  \]
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
  Find two distinct square roots of $i$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  We aim to find two different complex numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that
  $\alpha^2 = \beta^2 = i$. Suppose that $(a + bi)^2 = i$. Performing some
  algebra:

  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      (a + bi)^2       & = i \\
      a^2 - b^2 + 2abi & = i \\
    \end{aligned}
  \]

  We can interpret this result as a system of two equations:

  \[
    \begin{aligned}
      a^2 - b^2 & = 0 \\
      2ab       & = 1 \\
    \end{aligned}
  \]

  From the equation $a^2 - b^2 = 0$, we can gather that $a^2 = b^2$. This means
  that $a = b$. It is possible that $a = -b$ but it is not necessary to
  consider this for our purposes. Substituting this in the second equation
  gives that $2a^2 = 1$, and we can solve this for $a$ to get $a = \pm
  \sqrt{2}/2$.
\end{solution}
