\begin{exercise}{1}
  Let $G$ be a group and $a, b, c$ be elements of $G$. If $ab = ac$, show that
  $b = c$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  Since $G$ is a group, every element has an inverse. In particular, $a$ has
  inverse $a^{-1}$. If we multiply both sides of the equation $ab = ac$ by
  $a^{-1}$ on the left, we get that $b = c$ as required.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}{2}
  Let $G, G'$ be finite groups, of orders $m, n$ respectively. What is the
  order of $G \times G'$?
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  To pick an element of $G \times G'$, we choose an element from $G$, for which
  we have $m$ choices. Then we choose an element from $G'$, for which we have
  $n$ choices. Thus, the number of choices for an element of $G \times G'$ is
  $mn$, so the order of $G \times G'$ is $mn$.
\end{solution}
